## Getting Started

If you're new to trading, follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Sign Up with a Broker

1. To begin trading, you'll need to sign up with a Forex broker. If you don't have a broker yet, you can explore a list of reputable brokers at [Your Broker's Website](https://track.deriv.com/_KCH6LP9EQxwKqFKZ7JdnQ2Nd7ZgqdRLk/1/).

2. Click on the "Sign Up" or "Register" button on the broker's website.

3. Fill in your personal information, including your name, email address, and phone number. Make sure to use accurate details as they will be required for account verification.

4. Choose an account type that suits your trading preferences. Brokers often offer different account types with varying minimum deposit requirements.

5. Complete the registration process by agreeing to the broker's terms and conditions. You may also need to provide identity verification documents, such as a passport or driver's license.

6. Once your account is approved, you'll receive login credentials, including a username and password. Keep these details safe.

### Step 2: Install MetaTrader 5 (MT5)

1. Download and install MetaTrader 5 (MT5) from the official MetaQuotes website at [https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download).

2. Launch MetaTrader 5 and log in using the credentials provided by your broker.

### Step 3: Load AutoTrader.mq5 EA

1. In MetaTrader 5, open the "File" menu and select "Open Data Folder."

2. Navigate to the "MQL5" folder and then to "Experts."

3. Copy the "AutoTrader.mq5" file into the "Experts" folder.

4. Close and reopen MetaTrader 5 to ensure the EA is loaded.

### Step 4: Configure AutoTrader.mq5

1. In MetaTrader 5, go to the "Navigator" panel on the left.

2. Expand the "Expert Advisors" section.

3. Drag and drop "AutoTrader" onto a chart of the currency pair you want to trade.

4. Configure the RSI and stop loss settings as per your trading strategy.

### Step 5: Create a Custom Indicator

To create a custom indicator on MetaTrader 5 (MT5) like the one used in AutoTrader.mq5, follow these steps:

1. Open MetaEditor: Launch MetaEditor, the integrated development environment for MT5.

2. Create a New Indicator: In MetaEditor, go to `File > New > Indicator`. This will open a new script template.

3. Replace the Template with the code in the script file in this repository: Delete the default code in the new indicator file and paste the code you provided into the file.

4. Compile the Indicator: Save the file with a name, such as "CustomRSIIndicator.mq5". Then, click the "Compile" button in MetaEditor to compile the code. Make sure there are no compilation errors.

5. Check for Errors: Review the "Errors" and "Journal" tabs in MetaEditor to ensure there are no errors or warnings during compilation. Fix any issues that may arise.

6. Deploy the Indicator: Once the code compiles successfully, you can deploy the indicator to your MT5 platform. To do this, locate the compiled .ex5 file in the "MQL5\Indicators" folder within your MetaTrader directory. It should have the same name as your script (e.g., "CustomRSIIndicator.ex5").

7. Add the Indicator to a Chart: In MetaTrader 5, open the chart for the "Volatility 75 1s" symbol. Right-click on the chart, select "Indicators," and then choose "Custom." You should see your custom RSI indicator in the list of available indicators. Select it and configure any input parameters as needed.

8. Apply the Indicator: Click "OK" to apply the custom indicator to your chart. The indicator will now display RSI-based buy and sell signals.

### Step 6: Start Trading

Once configured, AutoTrader.mq5 will execute buy and sell orders automatically based on RSI signals. Monitor your trades using the MetaTrader 5 interface. Keep an eye on your account balance and trading performance.
